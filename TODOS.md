# CashFlux — Master Feature Backlog

Single source of truth, **ordered top-to-bottom by implementation priority**. Work in order;
within a section earlier items unblock later ones. Build **bottom-up** per the SDLC rule
(data model → services/logic with tests → persistence → state → UI last). See [`SPEC.md`](./SPEC.md)
for product detail and [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) for the rules.

**Legend:** `[ ]` todo · `[x]` done · `[~]` in progress · `(P#)` phase · `★` critical path.
**Discipline:** one feature per commit; update `CHANGELOG.md` + `DEVLOG.md` each commit; pure logic
packages have no `syscall/js` and ship with table-driven tests.

### 1.2 Money & currency — ★

- [x] ★ `internal/money`: `Money{Amount int64, Currency}`; `Add/Sub/Neg/Abs/Cmp/Equal/Sum`; tests
- [~] Money formatting per currency: `FormatMinor` (plain decimal) done; symbol/grouping/locale = UI layer
- [x] Money parsing: `ParseMinor` (strict decimal → minor units, validation, round-trip) + tests; grouping input later
- [x] ★ `internal/currency`: registry (code, symbol, decimals, name) + `Rates` table type
- [x] ★ `Rates.Convert` / `ToBase` rounding to target minor units (nearest; float-rate caveat noted)
- [x] Missing-rate + non-positive-rate error handling; tests for cross-currency + rounding
- [ ] Helper: format a `Money` in a target/base currency for display

### 1.3 Pure logic services — ★ (each in its own `internal/*` pkg, table-driven tests)

- [x] ★ `internal/id`: stable, collision-safe ID generation (seedable for tests)
- [x] `internal/dateutil`: month boundaries, fiscal-month start, week-start, period ranges

- [x] Tests for every service above (edge cases, multi-currency, rounding, boundaries)

### 1.4 Persistence — `internal/store` (pure-Go in-memory SQLite via `ncruces/go-sqlite3`) ★

- [x] ★ In-memory SQLite store (`NewMemory`) with clean `Load`/`Snapshot` dataset ingress/egress (builds for js/wasm + native)

- [x] Level config + contextual fields (`slog.With`/`WithGroup`)
- [x] Debug log viewer panel (in the Settings screen, newest-first + Refresh)
- [x] Tests for the handler/ring buffer (pure parts)

### 1.6 State wiring — `internal/appstate`

- [x] `internal/appstate` seam: in-memory store + slog logger, typed read accessors, validated
      write-through (`Put*`/`Delete*`), JSON export/import; `Init`/`Default` for screens
- [x] Boot hydration: `appstate.Init` loads sample data on boot (wired into `app.Run`)
- [x] Single persist path: every write goes through validated `appstate.Put*` → store (+ slog)
- [x] Reactive refresh per screen (`state.UseAtom` revision bumped after `appstate.Put*`) — Accounts add form
- [ ] Derived/computed selectors (net worth, totals, budget health) via `state.UseComputed` — with screens

- [ ] Responsive: mobile nav (drawer/hamburger), content widths

### 1.7c Dashboard UI & design system — selected design: `design/candidate-c.html` ★

The chosen visual direction is **candidate C** (flat neutral-dark · Fraunces serif headings + accounting
figures · bento grid · per-widget grip/title/gear · drag-reorder + resize · gear→flip settings ·
collapsible icon sidebar · global-settings flip). The static reference mockup is
[`design/candidate-c.html`](./design/candidate-c.html) (open via the dev server at
`/design/candidate-c.html`). Every item below is a Go/`html/shorthand` component to port from it.
Drag/resize/flip need pointer/drag events via `syscall/js`/`interop`; keep computation in the tested
logic packages, persist layout/settings to the store `Settings`.

**Reusability (required):** build these as generic, props-driven components shared across the whole
app — not per-widget bespoke markup. In particular: one `Widget` shell (grip/title/gear header slots
+ body slot), one `FlipPanel` primitive reused by **both** per-widget and global settings, one
settings-form renderer driven by a field schema, and shared primitives (`Toggle`, `Segmented`,
`StepperPill`, `Swatch`, `Chip`, `ProgressBar`, `Icon` set, and SVG `Chart` helpers). Every widget is
`Widget`-shell + content; every screen composes these. Mark each item below `(reuse)` where a single
component should serve many call sites.

Design tokens & foundation:
- [x] `internal/ui` tokens (mirror mockup `<style>`): palette + radii — Tailwind config + design-system CSS in host page; legacy screens retargeted to match

- [x] Accounting money display in UI (`$` + thousands + 2dp, **negatives in parentheses**, red/green) — `money.FormatAccounting` + `fmtAccounting`/`figTone`
- [x] Dark modern scrollbar styling for the scroll pane (`main.cf-scroll`)

App shell & navigation:
- [x] App shell: fixed left rail + independently scrolling `main`; sticky top bar
- [x] Sidebar rail: brand header; nav items each with an SVG icon — `internal/ui.Icon` + `navItem`
- [x] "My pages" section: example custom pages (+ colored page icons) and a "New page" action
- [x] Collapsible rail: toggle → 58px icon-only mode (shared `rail:collapsed` atom); reload-persist later
- [x] Household card (rail bottom) → opens global settings
- [x] Top bar: menu toggle, page title, time-resolution control, `+ Add`

Time-resolution control (top bar):
- [x] Segmented **Week / Month / Quarter** toggle (`ui.Segmented`)
- [x] **From / To** stepper pills that relabel per resolution; clamp From ≤ To (`period.Window`)

Bento grid system:
- [x] Grid engine: base cell unit `--cell` (152px), equal columns, uniform gap, integer cell spans
- [x] Visible squared cell borders; full-width header cell (1×N)
- [x] Widget shell: unified header — **grip · title · gear** + body (`ui.Widget`)
- [x] Drag-to-reorder / swap widgets (HTML5 DnD), keyed by widget id (`dashlayout.Swap`)
- [x] Resize: right/bottom handles → change col/row span (`dashlayout.Resize`; click-cycle for now, pointer-drag later)
- [~] Persist per-user layout — order + spans saved to `localStorage`; hidden/per-page + store persistence later

Per-widget settings (gear → flip):
- [x] Flip primitive: card lifts to center, dim/blur backdrop, 3D `rotateY` (`ui.FlipPanel`, reused for global)
- [x] Settings back: centered title + right ✕ close; scrollable body; dark Save/Cancel footer
- [~] Settings fields: editable Title + behavior toggles done; accent swatches/default size/refresh/Remove + persistence later

- [x] KPI tile — Net worth / Income / Spending / Liabilities (figure + subline)
- [x] Recent transactions (table, accounting amounts)
- [x] Budgets (progress bars, ok/near/over) — `internal/budgeting`
- [x] Net worth trend (SVG area chart) — `ledger.NetWorthSeries` + `chart`/`ui.AreaChart`
- [x] Goals (progress) — `internal/goals`
- [x] To-do (task list)
- [x] Accounts (mini balances)
- [x] Cash flow (in/out bar chart per period) — `ledger.PeriodTotals`

- [x] Savings rate (figure + bar)
- [x] Spending breakdown (segmented bar + legend by category)

Global settings (household card → large flip panel):
- [x] Large centered flip panel (2-column scrollable body), dark Save/Cancel
- [x] Household members (chips + add); Base currency; editable FX rate rows (live reads)
- [x] AI (OpenAI BYO key toggle + key + model); Appearance (theme seg + accent + density) — UI (local state)
