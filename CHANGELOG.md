# Changelog

All notable changes to CashFlux are documented here.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/). Policy: **one feature per commit**,
and every commit updates this file under `Unreleased`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Initialize Go module and `.gitignore`.
- Product specification (`SPEC.md`).
- Project rules and code-quality standards (`CLAUDE.md`), including version-control and journaling
  policy (one feature per commit, changelog + devlog).
- Developer journal (`DEVLOG.md`) and this changelog.
- Consume GoWebComponents as a versioned Go module via `go get` (no local `replace`); Phase 0
  WebAssembly entrypoint (`main.go`) that builds and renders.
- Host page (`index.html`) with wasm boot glue, served via the `gwc dev` live-reload server.
- Wire the `gwc` runner (`.tools/gwc.exe`) and its **MCP server** (`.mcp.json`) for development.
- Framework notes (`docs/GOWEBCOMPONENTS.md`) and a quick-reference section in `CLAUDE.md` for
  new/other sessions.
- Routed app shell (`internal/app`) with top navigation and stub screens for every feature
  (`internal/screens`).
- Master feature backlog (`TODOS.md`), ordered by implementation priority.
- `.gitattributes`: normalize text to LF in the repo and on checkout (ends the Windows CRLF/LF
  warnings) and mark `*.wasm` and common asset types as binary.

- `internal/money`: precise integer-minor-unit `Money` value type with safe, currency-checked
  arithmetic (`Add`/`Sub`/`Neg`/`Abs`/`Cmp`/`Sum`) and table-driven tests (backlog §1.1).
- `internal/money`: `FormatMinor`/`Money.Format` (plain decimal rendering) and `ParseMinor` (strict
  decimal → minor units with validation), round-trip tested — the basis for clean CSV and inputs.
- `internal/currency`: currency registry (code/symbol/decimals/name) + manual `Rates` table with
  base-currency `Convert`/`ToBase` (cross-currency, mixed decimals, nearest-minor rounding) + tests.
- `internal/id`: collision-resistant 128-bit hex ID generator (optional prefix; seedable source for
  deterministic tests) + tests.
- `internal/dateutil`: canonical date parsing/formatting plus month, week, and fiscal-month range
  helpers, `InRange`, and DST-safe `DaysBetween` + tests.
- `internal/domain`: core entity types (`Member`, `Account` incl. liability + allocation fields,
  `Category`, `Transaction`, `Budget`, `Goal`, `Task`) with custom-field maps, plus validated
  enumerations (`AccountClass`/`AccountType`/`CategoryKind`/`Scope`/`Period`/`TaskStatus`/
  `TaskPriority`/`RelatedType`/`TaskSource`), `AccountType.Class()`, transaction classification, and tests.
- `internal/ledger`: account `Balance`/`RunningBalances`, period income/expense totals (transfers
  excluded), `NetWorth` (assets − liabilities), and per-owner net rollups — all multi-currency via
  base conversion + tests.
- `internal/budgeting`: scope-aware `Spent` (individual vs group), `Evaluate`/`EvaluateAll` with
  remaining, percent, and ok/near/over `State` thresholds — multi-currency + tests.
- `internal/goals`: goal `Remaining`, `Percent` (clamped), `IsComplete`, and `Project` (read-only
  completion estimate from an assumed monthly contribution) via `Evaluate` + tests.
- `internal/freshness`: per-type staleness `Windows` (defaults + `Merge` overrides), `IsStale`,
  `DaysSinceUpdate`, and `StaleAccounts`; archived/exempt/untracked accounts never go stale + tests.
- `internal/validate`: per-entity validators returning all `Issues` at once (required fields, valid
  enums, positive amounts, currency consistency, class/type match, score/day ranges, related refs) + tests.
  Completes the Phase 1 pure-logic services layer.
- `internal/store`: pure `Dataset` aggregate + `Settings`, with schema-versioned JSON `Export`/
  `Import` (migration; rejects newer schema) and a lossless round-trip test. Storage-backend-agnostic
  — also the sync/transfer payload.
- `internal/store`: in-memory **SQLite** store backed by the pure-Go (no-cgo) `ncruces/go-sqlite3`
  driver, with `Load`/`Snapshot` clean dataset ingress/egress + round-trip tests. Verified to build
  for `js/wasm` (browser) and run natively.
- `internal/store`: per-entity CRUD (Put/Get/Delete/List for members, accounts, categories,
  transactions, budgets, goals, tasks) and query helpers (transactions by account/category/member/
  date-range via SQLite `json_extract`; tasks by status) + tests.
- `internal/store`: `TransactionsToCSV`/`TransactionsFromCSV` — human-readable CSV with decimal
  amounts, header-name column matching (order/extra-column tolerant), generated ids for id-less rows,
  and per-line error reporting; lossless round-trip tested.
- `internal/store`: `Get/PutSettings` accessors, atomic `Wipe`, and a valid `SampleDataset` starter
  seed (validated in tests). Completes the Phase 1 persistence layer.
- `internal/logging`: `log/slog`-based `Handler` writing human-readable lines to any `io.Writer`
  plus a bounded, concurrency-safe `Ring` buffer for an in-app log viewer; supports level filtering
  and `With`/`WithGroup` contextual attrs + tests.
- `internal/appstate`: the UI↔persistence/logic seam — owns the in-memory store + slog logger, with
  typed read accessors, validated write-through (`Put*`/`Delete*`), JSON export/import, and
  `Init`/`Default`; wired into `app.Run` to seed sample data on boot. Pure Go + native tests.
- Accounts screen: first real, data-backed screen — assets/liabilities grouped with live per-account
  balances (`internal/ledger`) and a net-worth/assets/liabilities summary, reading from `appstate`.
  Shared money display helpers (`fmtMoney`, amount classes).
- Dashboard screen: real headline metrics — net worth, this-month income/expense (via
  `ledger.PeriodTotals` over the current month), active-account count, and a recent-activity list.
- Accounts add form: create an account (name, type, owner, currency, opening balance) with
  validated write-through and a reactive refresh (`state.UseAtom` revision bump). First mutating
  feature. Added row/form/amount styles to the host page.
- Accounts per-row delete via an `AccountRow` component (stable `On*` hook) with `MapKeyed` keyed
  rendering; deleting refreshes the screen and net-worth summary.
- Transactions screen: add income/expense (account-aware currency, category/date), newest-first
  list, and per-row delete (`TransactionRow`), all with validated write-through and reactive refresh.
- Budgets screen: current-month spend vs limit per budget via `internal/budgeting` with a colored
  ok/near/over progress bar, plus add and per-row delete.
- Goals screen: savings goals with a progress bar (% complete + remaining via `internal/goals`),
  optional target date, plus add and per-row delete.
- To-do screen: tasks with priority badges and due dates — add, complete-toggle, delete, sorted
  (open first, then by due date).
- Dashboard design exploration: five HTML/Tailwind candidates in `design/`; **candidate C selected**
  (flat neutral-dark, Fraunces serif headings + accounting figures, bento grid, per-widget
  grip/title/gear header, drag-reorder + edge resize, gear→flip settings, collapsible icon sidebar,
  global-settings flip).
- Granular, reusability-focused component backlog for the candidate-C dashboard UI (`TODOS.md` §1.7c),
  every item referencing `design/candidate-c.html`.
- Dashboard design-system foundation in the host page: Fraunces + Inter web fonts, the candidate-C
  Tailwind palette/type config, and the full candidate-C component CSS (bento grid, unified widget
  header, drag/resize handles, flip-settings panel, dark scroll pane, sidebar collapse, control
  primitives) — ported verbatim from `design/candidate-c.html`, ready for the Go component port.
- `internal/money`: `Group` (thousands separators) and `FormatAccounting` — accounting-style display
  (`$1,234.56`, negatives in parentheses like `($240.55)`, always `decimals` places, caller-supplied
  symbol) for the candidate-C figure style; table-driven tests. Pure, no currency-registry dependency.
- `internal/ui`: new shared design-system package (Go port of `design/candidate-c.html`) with a
  reusable, props-driven `Icon` primitive — the candidate-C stroked SVG icon set (dashboard, accounts,
  transactions, budgets, goals, to-do, settings, page, plus, menu) that inherits color/size from the caller.

### Changed
- App shell replaced the top-navigation chrome with the candidate-C layout: a fixed left rail
  (brand + icon-led primary navigation with active highlighting and router navigation) and an
  independently scrolling main pane with a sticky top bar (menu toggle, page title, Add action).
  `internal/app` now composes `internal/ui` primitives (`Icon`); screen bodies render inside the
  new `main` scroll pane.
- Rail completed with the candidate-C lower groups: a **My pages** section (example custom pages with
  colored page icons + a muted "New page" action), a **System** group (Settings), and a
  household card pinned to the bottom that shows live member count and base currency and opens
  Settings. `navItem` is now reusable across all groups (optional path for placeholders, custom icon
  class, muted styling).
- Collapsible rail: the top-bar menu button toggles the sidebar into 58px icon-only mode (labels,
  captions, brand text, and household summary hidden), coordinated by a shared `rail:collapsed`
  state atom so the button and rail stay in sync.
- `internal/ui`: reusable `Segmented` (mutually-exclusive option toggle) and `StepperPill`
  (label + prev/next chevrons) control primitives — generic and props-driven, each interactive
  child its own component so click hooks stay stable in lists.
- `internal/period`: pure time-resolution model for the dashboard control — `Resolution`
  (week/month/quarter) with anchor `Truncate`/`Step`/`Label` and `Range` (from/to anchors → a
  half-open reporting range, clamped). Table-driven tests cover quarter boundaries, week starts,
  cross-year stepping, and range spanning. Pure, native-tested.
- `internal/period`: immutable `Window` value (resolution + from/to anchors + week start) with the
  control's stepping rules — `SetResolution` (re-snaps anchors), `StepFrom`/`StepTo` (move one
  anchor, clamping the other so from ≤ to), `Range`, and from/to labels. Drops straight into UI
  state; clamp behavior table-driven tested.
- Time-resolution control in the top bar: a Week/Month/Quarter `Segmented` toggle plus From/To
  `StepperPill`s, backed by a shared `internal/uistate` window atom over `period.Window`. The
  dashboard now derives its income/spending period from this control (re-rendering on change) instead
  of a hardcoded current-month range; stat labels are now period-relative ("Income"/"Spending").
- `internal/ui`: reusable `Widget` shell — the candidate-C bento cell with the unified header (grip ·
  centered title · gear) and a padded body, props-driven (title, body, grid span, draggable,
  resizable, gear handler) so every dashboard widget is `Widget` + content. Optional edge resize
  handles; gear is its own component for stable hooks in lists.
- `internal/ui`: reusable `FlipPanel` settings overlay — the candidate-C dimmed/blurred backdrop with
  a card that lifts and 3D-flips to a settings back face (centered title, close button, scrollable
  body, dark Save/Cancel footer). Generic (title, body, size, Save/close handlers) and reused by both
  per-widget and global settings; the open animation runs once on mount via `UseState`/`UseEffect`.
- `internal/ui`: reusable `Toggle` (pill switch) + `ToggleRow` (labeled settings row), `Swatch`
  (color chip) + `SwatchPicker` (accent row) control primitives — the building blocks of the settings
  forms, generic and props-driven, each interactive element its own component.
- Dashboard rebuilt as the candidate-C **bento grid**: a full-width header cell plus four KPI widgets
  (Net worth, Income, Spending, Liabilities) built from the live ledger and shown as accounting
  figures (`$1,234.56` / `($240.55)`, green/red tone). Each KPI is the reusable `Widget` shell +
  content; Income/Spending follow the time-resolution window. New `fmtAccounting`/`figTone` helpers.
- Recent transactions widget (2×2) on the dashboard: newest activity as a compact table with short
  dates and accounting amounts (green/red), in the reusable `Widget` shell.
- `internal/ui`: reusable `ProgressBar` primitive — the candidate-C thin rounded track + colored fill
  (clamped percent, tone class, extra spacing), reused by budgets, goals, and savings-rate widgets.
- Budgets widget (1×2) on the dashboard: current-month spend per budget with an ok/near/over
  `ProgressBar` and percent (green/amber/red), via `internal/budgeting`. Always month-scoped since
  budgets are monthly.
- Persistence switched from IndexedDB to pure-Go in-memory SQLite (`ncruces/go-sqlite3`, no cgo, no
  dependency on browser web storage); the JSON `Dataset` remains the portable import/export and sync
  payload. (Confirmed pure-Go SQLite compiles for `js/wasm` and runs in the browser.)
- Expanded `TODOS.md` into a granular, per-entity/service/screen backlog covering the full spec.
- Serve web assets from `web/` (clean project root); restyled host page with a dark theme.
- Require bottom-up SDLC build order in `CLAUDE.md` (data model → services/logic with tests →
  persistence → state → UI last).
