# CashFlux — Developer Journal

Narrative companion to `CHANGELOG.md`. Newest entries first. Capture decisions, trade-offs,
problems and fixes, and what's next.

## 2026-06-15 — Phase 1 begins: data model (money)

- Started executing the backlog at §1.1, SDLC bottom-up. First service: `internal/money` — a
  precise `Money{Amount int64, Currency string}` type (integer minor units, never float), with
  currency-checked `Add`/`Sub`/`Cmp`/`Neg`/`Abs`/`Sum`. Pure Go, no `syscall/js`; table-driven
  tests pass on native Go (`go test ./internal/money`).
- Renamed the master backlog to `TODOS.md` (project-wide tracking list).

- Added `internal/currency`: registry + manual `Rates` table + `Convert`/`ToBase` (cross-currency
  via base, mixed decimals, nearest-minor rounding). A rounding test surfaced a good lesson —
  `1.005` as float64 is `1.00499…`, so exact half-cents aren't representable; tests now use
  float-stable rounding cases and the conversion rounds to the nearest minor unit.
- Expanded `TODOS.md` to a granular per-entity/service/screen backlog (full spec coverage).

- Added `internal/id`: 128-bit hex IDs via crypto/rand, optional prefix, seedable source for
  deterministic tests. (Test helper lesson: a single-byte counter wraps at 256 and collides — the
  uniqueness test now uses real crypto/rand.)
- Running as a self-paced `/loop`: one feature per iteration, granular commit + CHANGELOG each, with
  a ~1-minute cooldown between features.

- Added `internal/dateutil`: canonical date parse/format, month/week/fiscal-month ranges,
  half-open `InRange`, and DST-safe `DaysBetween` (computed via UTC calendar dates).

- Added `internal/domain`: all core entity types with custom-field maps and JSON tags, plus
  validated enums (`Valid()`/`String()`/`All*`), `AccountType.Class()`/`IsLiability()`, and
  `Transaction.IsTransfer/IsIncome/IsExpense`. Scope uses individual|shared (shared == group-level,
  owner `GroupOwnerID`). Tests cover enum validity, class mapping, and transaction classification.

**Next:** `internal/ledger` (account balance from opening + transactions, running balance,
income/expense totals excluding transfers, net worth, per-member/group rollups) with tests.

## 2026-06-15 — Project kickoff & spec

- **Toolchain (fresh Windows machine):** installed GitHub CLI, portable Git, and Go 1.26.4 into
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs` and added them to the user PATH (no admin; MSI installs were blocked).
- **Repo:** created `CashFlux`, initialized git on `main`. Name chosen with the owner.
- **Framework study:** analyzed the local `GoWebComponents` checkout — confirmed the public API
  (shorthand element + control-flow funcs, `ui` hooks, `state` atoms, history `router`), the
  module wiring needed for a standalone app (local `replace` + mirrored `agenthub`/GoGRPCBridge
  replaces), and a key gotcha: `On*` prop options register hooks on wasm, so per-row handlers must
  live in their own row components.
- **Spec:** iterated with the owner and locked Phase 1. Highlights: local-first, household/group
  aware (members, individual pools, group budgets), full asset+liability accounts (incl. informal
  "loan shark" debts), multi-currency with a manual FX table, freshness nudges, custom fields +
  formula builder, planning + to-do, OpenAI client-side (BYO key) for document parsing/insights,
  and a capital-allocation suggestion engine.
- **Standards:** wrote `CLAUDE.md` — pure idiomatic Go, clean architecture (logic packages with no
  `syscall/js`, unit-tested on native Go), `log/slog` logging, readable plain-English UI,
  import/export, heavy configurability, and strict VCS/journaling (one feature per commit).

- **Dependency cleanup:** replaced the local `../GoWebComponents` `replace` with a real `go get`
  module pin (pseudo-version `v1.1.1-0.20260613162601-cad8af8`). `go mod tidy` + wasm build are
  clean — `agenthub` is pruned (core packages don't import it); only `cbor`/`float16`/`goldmark`
  come along indirect. Phase 0 wasm entrypoint builds (6.17 MB).
- **Tooling:** built `gwc` from the framework checkout and wired it as `.tools/gwc.exe` + the `gwc`
  MCP server (`.mcp.json`, 81 `gwc_*` tools). Wrote `docs/GOWEBCOMPONENTS.md` and a CLAUDE.md
  quick-reference for new sessions. Moved pre-spec draft files to `_scratch/` (Go-ignored).

- **Skeleton:** built the routed app shell (`internal/app`: router + `Shell` + `NavBar`) and stub
  screens for all 12 features (`internal/screens`), driven by a single screen registry. Verified on
  the live `gwc dev` server (HTTP 200 for `/`, wasm, and glue; hot reload active).
- **Layout cleanup:** moved web/build assets under `web/` so the project root holds only Go source,
  config, and docs — clean and standard.
- **Framework bug found (parked):** `gwc dev` resolves `-html` relative to the build/module root,
  not the serve `-root` (contradicts its flag help). Workaround: pass `-html web\index.html`. Proper
  fix is in GoWebComponents `tools/gwc/dev.go` — to be done, then rebuild + recopy `gwc`.
- **Planning:** wrote `TODO.md`, the priority-ordered master backlog, and made bottom-up SDLC
  (model → services → store → UI) an explicit rule in `CLAUDE.md`.

**Next (per SDLC + TODO §1.1):** start the data model — `internal/domain` types + `internal/money`
and `internal/currency` services with table-driven tests — before any feature UI.

**Note:** a few pre-spec exploratory Go files (model/persist/dashboard/transactions/components)
remain in the tree from early prototyping; they predate the locked spec and will be replaced to
match it during Phase 1.
